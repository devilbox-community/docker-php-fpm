SourceGuardian loaders differ for OS, platform and version of PHP. We strongly recommend that you use our online SourceGuardian loader assistant to know the loader you need for your system and how to install it. You will need to enter a link to the phpinfo() page running on your server or paste its contents if your system is not online.
